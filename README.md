# Landmark-Recognition-with-Keras

## Time to tell a story...
Well, I m finishing my master degree in Artificial Inteligent in the "Universidad Politecnica de Madrid" [MUIA](http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/masteria/?q=es/MUIA) and i will present this Neural Network as my final proyect.
I have always liked robots, and in the master degree i had a robot assignature where i had a project with visual landmarks 
As i live in a student residece while i am study in Madrid i though "Ey Amable, why don't you take photos from the residence and train a CNN to identify every important point of the residence? It could be fun!" 
And that is how i have finished doing this proyect.

## The Neural Network
Actually, the Neural Network works... badly.

It only has a 25% of accuracy and has overfitting.

And it has other problems i will solve in the future... But i think i will finish it in time.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

You have the data folder, where there are all the images i use to train the Neural Network, and you have 2 Neural Network Jupyter Notebooks: one test the Neural Network on Google Colab and other to test the Neural Network on your computer desktop.

Thanks for read me!
